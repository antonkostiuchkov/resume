## Resume template

The idea behind this project is to help people without coding experience have their CV up and runing online, with a link to share. Theiy can fork this repo and fill in personal information in:

  _data/settings.yml
  
With the help of jekyll templating system users would magically get their own version for a given template.

Ideally I want to create several templates to choose from, that are fully responsive.
